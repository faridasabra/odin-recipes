    <h3>How to Make Swiss Roll</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Whip the eggs.</strong> Beat eggs for 3 minutes on medium-high speed until frothy and pale in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or in a large mixing bowl if using an electric hand mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Beat in sugar.</strong> Gradually add sugar and beat for 4-5 minutes longer, until it nearly triples in volume and is very thick, pale and fluffy and billowy like shaving cream or marshmallow fluff. When you lift the mixture up with the beater and it slides back down into the base mixture, it should fall back onto itself in folds or ribbons rather than sink down into it. Mix in salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Add wet ingredients.</strong> Combine milk, oil, vinegar and vanilla and then mix it into the whipped eggs gently.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients.</strong> Sift flour and baking powder into a medium bowl and whisk to blend evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix wet and dry ingredients.</strong> Sift the dry ingredients again over and into the bowl with the egg mixture and use a large rubber spatula to carefully fold the dry ingredients into the whipped egg mixture just until combined without over-mixing.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake.</strong> Spread batter evenly into prepared pan in a thin layer. Bake for 12-15 minutes until it springs back when pressed gently. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool for 3 minutes so it is easier to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll.</strong> Dust top of cake evenly with icing. Run a knife along the edges of the pan to release the cake, then invert it onto a clean kitchen towel or another large piece of parchment paper. Gently peel off the top layer of parchment. While the cake is still warm, gently roll it into a log starting from the short side and incorporating the kitchen towel or parchment as you are rolling. Let the cake cool completely in this rolled shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the cake.</strong> Unroll the cake, spread the filling over it leaving about Â½ inch border and then gently roll up the cake again. Transfer to a baking tray and refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.</li>
